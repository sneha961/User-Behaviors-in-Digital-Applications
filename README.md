# User-Behaviors-in-Digital-Applications

We will be working on understanding the behaviors and characteristics of people who use a digital application. The product offers recommendations on nearby attractions, restaurants, and businesses based on the user’s location. This includes a free version for any user along with a subscription model that provides more customized recommendations for users who pay for the service.

With free installation on a mobile device, digital applications have a low barrier to entry. They also experience high rates of attrition, as users may not continue to log in. With this in mind, the company is interested in better understanding the early experience of users with the application. A time point of 30 days was selected as an important milestone. Which factors might impact whether new users remain active beyond 30 days? Who is likely to subscribe within 30 days?

The company would benefit from analyzing the available data to understand the current trends, and has gathered some simple information about new users of the application. A simple random sample of users was taken by gathering information in the company’s database. The sample was limited only to users who first installed the application in the last 6 months, when a new version of the application was released. The sample was further limited to users who signed up and had enough time for the company to measure its key milestones. To ensure reasonable comparisons, the data were limited to users in Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and the United States, which were deemed appropriately similar in terms of their linguistic and economic characteristics.

For each user, basic information (age group, gender, and country) was collected from the user’s profile. Then the following characteristics were measured:

daily_sessions: This is the average number of sessions per day in the first 30 days for each user. One session consists of a period of active use as measured by the company’s database. Then the daily sessions for a user is the total number of sessions for the period divided by 30.
subscribed_30: This measure (TRUE/FALSE) indicates whether the user paid for any subscription service within 30 days.
active_30: This measures (TRUE/FALSE) whether the user remained active at 30 days. The company decided to measure this by identifying whether the user had at least one active session in the 7-day period after the first 30 days.
